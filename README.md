## Overview

The
[`SnowflakeMLForecast`](https://sfc-gh-jdemlow.github.io/cortex_forecast/cortex_forecast.html#snowflakemlforecast)
class is a flexible tool designed for creating, managing, and analyzing
forecast models within Snowflake using the
`CREATE SNOWFLAKE.ML.FORECAST` functionality. It allows users to define
models, configure inputs, generate forecasts, and visualize results
seamlessly.

## Features

- Dynamic Forecast Model Creation: Automatically generates SQL queries
  to create forecast models based on configuration files.
- Visualization: Integrates with both Streamlit and standard Python
  environments to display forecast results and key data aspects.
- Tag Management: Handles the creation of tags in Snowflake and ensures
  smooth operation even if tags already exist.
- Configurable: Supports YAML configuration files for easy setup and
  flexibility.
- Error Handling: Robust error handling and user feedback for a seamless
  experience.

## Installation

### Requirements

- Python 3.7+
- Snowflake Connector
- Pandas
- Altair (for visualizations)
- Streamlit (optional, for UI)

### Setup

1.  Clone the Repository:

2.  Install Dependencies:

3.  Set Up Configuration: Create a YAML file with your configuration
    settings (explained below).

## Configuration

The
[`SnowflakeMLForecast`](https://sfc-gh-jdemlow.github.io/cortex_forecast/cortex_forecast.html#snowflakemlforecast)
class relies on a YAML configuration file to define the input data,
forecast settings, and other options. Below is an example configuration:

> This configuration is what is used in the storage example to be able
> to forecast your snowflake storage usage.

``` yaml
model:
  name: my_forecast_model
  tags:
    environment: production
    team: data_science
  comment: "Forecast model for predicting trends."

input_data:
  table: storage_usage_train
  table_type: table  # Options: 'table', 'view'
  timestamp_column: usage_date
  target_column: storage_gb
  series_column: null  # Set to column name for multiple time series
  exogenous_columns: # Or [column1, column2] if thre are no columns it will use all columns in the view or table
    - column1
    - column2

forecast_config:
  training_days: 180
  forecast_days: 30
  config_object:
    on_error: skip
    evaluate: true
    evaluation_config:
      n_splits: 2 # Default is 2
      gap: 0 # Default is 0
      prediction_interval: 0.95

output:
  table: storage_forecast_results
```

## Usage

### Creating a SnowflakeMLForecast Instance

``` python
# Step 1: Create a Forecast Model Instance

# Define your connection configuration
connection_config = {
    'user': 'your_user',
    'password': 'your_password',
    'account': 'your_account',
    'database': 'your_database',
    'warehouse': 'your_warehouse',
    'schema': 'your_schema',
    'role': 'your_role'
}

# Create an instance of SnowflakeMLForecast
forecast_model = SnowflakeMLForecast(
    config_file='path/to/your/config.yaml',
    connection_config=connection_config
)

# Step 2: Run Forecast and Visualize Results
forecast_data = forecast_model.create_and_run_forecast()
forecast_model.generate_forecast_and_visualization()

# Step 3: Clean Up
forecast_model.cleanup()
```

# Full Example

> See in Docs/ folder for two example of this in action. One is for
> storage and the other is for Taxi Pick up in NYC.

``` python
from snowflake.snowpark.version import VERSION
from cortex_forecast.forecast import SnowflakeMLForecast
import os
```

## Create Snowflake Connection Using SnowflakeMLForecast

> Note: Make sure that you create a yaml file that you would like to so
> that the SnowflakeMLForecast can read the connection information from
> it and be able to build your forecast.

``` python
forecast_model = SnowflakeMLForecast(
   config='./cortex_forecast/files/yaml/storage_forecast_config.yaml',
    connection_config={
        'user': os.getenv('SNOWFLAKE_USER'),
        'password': os.getenv('SNOWFLAKE_PASSWORD'),
        'account': os.getenv('SNOWFLAKE_ACCOUNT'),
        'database': 'CORTEX',
        'warehouse': 'CORTEX_WH',
        'schema': 'DEV',
        'role': 'CORTEX_USER_ROLE'  # Use the desired role
    },
    is_streamlit=False
)

snowflake_environment = forecast_model.session.sql('SELECT current_user(), current_version()').collect()
snowpark_version = VERSION
print('\nConnection Established with the following parameters:')
print('Snowflake version           : {}'.format(snowflake_environment[0][1]))
print('Snowpark for Python version : {}.{}.{}'.format(snowpark_version[0], snowpark_version[1], snowpark_version[2]))
```

``` python
# Create Training Data
training_days = 365

forecast_model.session.sql(f'''CREATE OR REPLACE TABLE storage_usage_train AS
    SELECT 
        TO_TIMESTAMP_NTZ(usage_date) AS usage_date,
        storage_bytes / POWER(1024, 3) AS storage_gb
    FROM 
    (
        SELECT * 
            FROM snowflake.account_usage.storage_usage
            WHERE usage_date < CURRENT_DATE()
    )
    WHERE TO_TIMESTAMP_NTZ(usage_date) > DATEADD(day, -{training_days}, CURRENT_DATE())
''').collect()
forecast_model.session.sql('SELECT * FROM storage_usage_train ORDER BY usage_date DESC LIMIT 10').show()
```

``` python
import pandas as pd
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
```

``` python
df = forecast_model.session.sql('SELECT * FROM storage_usage_train ORDER BY usage_date').to_pandas()
df.head()
df = df.set_index('USAGE_DATE')
df['STORAGE_GB'].plot(figsize=(10, 6), title='Storage GB Over Time')

# Show the plot
plt.xlabel('Date')
plt.ylabel('Storage GB')
plt.grid(True)
plt.show()
```

### Train a Model

> This will use what is inside of the yaml file that you created that
> you passed over to the SnowflakeMLForecast object

``` python
# Run Forecast
forecast_data = forecast_model.create_and_run_forecast()
forecast_data.head()
```

### Visualize Forecast

``` python
forecast_model.generate_forecast_and_visualization(show_historical=True)
```
